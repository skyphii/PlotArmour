# PlotArmour
Spigot plugin that makes you the main character!
Designed to modify the the typical speedrunning path.


# To-do
- ~~auto nether portal~~
- ~~witch saves player from lava~~
- ~~endermen hand over pearls~~
- ~~(creeper) explosions heal~~
- ~~blaze shoots snowballs~~
- ~~void launch~~
- ~~piglins flock player and throw items~~
    - ~~spawned wolves are automatically tamed~~
- something to navigate to nether fortress
- eyes of ender launch player towards stronghold (?)
- silverfish are friends?
- investigate plausbility of arrows bouncing between end crystals (likely will abandon this if it doesn't work out)
- if not bouncing arrows, auto-aim. could theoretically deal damage to endcrystal/dragon when player shoots arrow (and delete arrow instantly)
- spawn fountain of OP loot from dragon death
